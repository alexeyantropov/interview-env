# Task 000-example

A candidate has to run '/bin/start-me' web-server and get a secret message via HTTP from the web-server without curl or wget utility (nc or telnet utils are allowed).

The candidate may want to use the 'kill' command/call during the troubleshooting . It's an acceptable way but a better way (to get the higher grade) isn't using the 'kill' to run the web-server.

The candidate SHOULDN'T open the source code! All sources are open (because it's an example) and I use Python to  make them more readable.
